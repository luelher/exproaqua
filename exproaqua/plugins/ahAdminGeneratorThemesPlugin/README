# ahAdminGeneratorThemesPlugin plugin #

The `ahAdminGeneratorThemesPlugin` is a symfony plugin that provides two symfony admin generator themes with additional features.

A big thanks goes out to Francois Zaninotto who provided the Propel implementation of this. I simply ported it to Doctrine. :)

## Installation ##

  * Install the plugin (via a package)

        symfony plugin:install ahAdminGeneratorThemesPlugin

  * Install the plugin (via a Subversion checkout)
  
        svn co http://svn.symfony-project.com/plugins/ahAdminGeneratorThemesPlugin/trunk plugins/ahAdminGeneratorThemesPlugin

  * Install the plugin (via a Git clone)
  
        git clone git://github.com/annismckenzie/ahAdminGeneratorThemesPlugin

  * Activate the plugin in `config/ProjectConfiguration.class.php`
  
        [php]
        class ProjectConfiguration extends sfProjectConfiguration
        {
          public function setup()
          {
            $this->enablePlugins(array(
              'sfDoctrinePlugin', 
              'ahAdminGeneratorThemesPlugin',
              '...'
            ));
          }
        }
  
  * To enable a theme, edit your `generator.yml` and change the `theme` property from `admin` to `ahAdmin` (or `ahAdminGeneratorThemesPluginAdmin`), as follows:
  
        [yaml]
        generator:
          class: sfDoctrineGenerator
          param:
            model_class:           Book
            theme:                 ahAdmin        # or: ahAdminGeneratorThemesPluginAdmin
            non_verbose_templates: true
            with_show:             false
            singular:              Book
            plural:                Books
            route_prefix:          book
            with_doctrine_route:   true
            actions_base_class:    sfActions

You can now use the additional features listed below.

## Additional features to the standard symfony Doctrine admin generator ##

### Sorting On A Virtual Column ###

The new theme provides an easy way to make virtual columns sortable in the list view. Just declare the corresponding fields with `is_sortable` to `true`, and the generated module will look for an `orderByXXX()` method in the generated query. For instance, to allow a book list to be sortable on the author name:

    [yaml]
    # in generator.yml
    list:
      display: [title, Author]
      fields: 
        - Author:      { is_sortable: true }

Then the generator will try to execute `BookTable::orderByAuthor()` whenever the user clicks on the `Author` header to sort on this column. The method must be implemented as follows:

    [php]
    class BookTable extends Doctrine_Table
    {
      public function orderByAuthor(Doctrine_Query $q, $direction = 'asc')
      {
        return $q->orderBy($q->getRootAlias().'.Author.Lastname '.$direction);
      }
    }

You can override the default sorting method name for a field by setting the `sort_method` parameter:

    [yaml]
    # in generator.yml
    list:
      display: [title, Author]
      fields: 
        - Author:      { is_sortable: true, sort_method: orderByAuthorLastName }
        
The generator will execute `BookTable::orderByAuthorLastName()` instead of `BookTable::orderByAuthor()` in that case. 

And there you have it. Now it's possible to sort on any column, be that a virtual column or a partial. What you have to figure out for yourself is, especially for partials that display multiple columns, the sort column and the direction, so the sorting is meaningful for the user.

### Customizable titles ###

With the standard admin generator theme it's tedious to style the titles (list, new and edit) because they are hard-coded like this:

    [php]
    <h1>[List, New, Edit] Title</h1>

To mitigate this I wrapped this up in the module_header slot. All you need to do is add a partial "_module_header.php" with the following content:

    [php]
    <h1 class="whatever"><?php get_slot('module_header') ?></h1>

And include that partial in your layout like so:

    [php]
    <?php include_partial('module_or_global/module_header') ?>

Unfortunately, you'll need to do this even if you don't want to add CSS classes or other things to your headers but I think the advantages far outweigh the disadvantages. :)

I also recommend you install the `tsTitlePlugin` as it will make html &lt;title&gt; cascading possible like so: "AdminModule > Object".

## ahAdminGeneratorThemesPluginAdmin: more additional features! ##

This theme is not for the faint of heart. It needs the plugins `ahToolkitPlugin` and `sfDoctrineGuardPlugin` to work and you'll need to add a method to your myUser.class.php.

    [php]
    # in apps/frontend/lib/myUser.class.php
    class myUser extends sfGuardSecurityUser
    {
      public function getNextRedirect($remove = true)
      {    
        return $remove ? $this->getAttributeHolder()->remove('next_redirect', '@homepage') : 
          $this->getAttribute('next_redirect', '@homepage');
      }
      
      public function setNextRedirect($route)
      {
        $this->setAttribute('next_redirect', $route);
      }
    }

Now, activate the `ahCommon` module in your `settings.yml` and add this to your layout:

    [php]
    <?php include_partial('ahCommon/flashes') ?>

This is to display the flash messages.

Pfew, I might have forgotten something. But you can contact me, see the end of this README. :)

### Configurable show view ###

Activate the show view generation in the `generator.yml`:
  
    [yaml]
    generator:
      class: sfDoctrineGenerator
      param:
        ...
        with_show:             true
        ...

And configure it like so:

    [yaml]
    # in generator.yml
    show:
      display: [...]

### Different form classes for the new and edit screens ###

This should be pretty self-explanatory:

    [yaml]
    # in generator.yml
    new:
      class: NewBookForm
    edit:
      class: EditBookForm
